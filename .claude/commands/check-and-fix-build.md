description: Checks for any build errors and fixes them.

# Goal

Navigate to our frontend web app directory (`apps/web/`) and run the build process to check for any errors. Please fix any errors you encounter that prevent the build and re-run the build process. Continue until the build is successful, whilst making sure you do not alter the functionality of the app in any way.
